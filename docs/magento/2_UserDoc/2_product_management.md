3. **Add Product:** Click on `Products` and then `Catalog` to access the product grid. Click on the "Add Product" button.

4. **Select Product Type:** Choose the product type you want to add (Simple Product, Configurable Product, etc.) and click "Continue."
   | | |
   |--------------------|------------------------------------------|
   | **Simple Product** | A standalone product with no variations. |
   | **Configurable Product** | A product with multiple variations (e.g., size and color) that customers can choose from. |
   | **Grouped Product** | Multiple simple products sold as a group. |
   | **Virtual Product**| Downloadable or intangible products with no physical presence. |
   | **Bundle Product** | A combination of simple and/or virtual products sold together. |

5. **Fill in Product Details:** Complete the required fields such as product name, SKU, price, and quantity. Add additional information like images, description, and other relevant details.

6. **Save and Continue:** Click "Save and Continue Edit" to proceed with further configuration, or "Save" if you've entered all necessary information.

## Configuring Product Attributes

1. **Attribute Set:** Define attribute sets under **`Stores > Attributes > Attribute Set`**. Create attribute sets that align with your product types.

2. **Product Attributes:** Configure specific attributes under **`Stores > Attributes > Product`**. Customize attributes like color, size, or any other relevant options.

3. **Assign Attributes:** Associate attributes with your attribute sets.

## Creating Configurable Products

If you're selling products with multiple variations (e.g., different sizes and colors):

1. **Select Configurable Product:** Create a new product and select the "Configurable Product" type.

2. **Attribute Configuration:** Choose the attributes (e.g., size, color) that define the product variations.

3. **Associate Simple Products:** Link the simple products representing each variation to the configurable product.

4. **Configure Options:** Set up options for each variation, including prices and quantities.

## Category Management

1. **Create Categories:** Organize your products by creating categories under **`Catalog > Categories`**. Add categories that reflect your product hierarchy.

2. Assign Products to Categories: In the product edit page, assign products to relevant categories.

## Inventory Management

1. Set Stock Quantity: In the product edit page, manage the product's stock quantity and availability under the **"Inventory"** section.

2. Configure Stock Options: Define stock options such as backorders and stock status under **`Stores > Configuration > Catalog > Inventory`**.

## Product Images and Galleries

1. **Add Images:** Upload product images under the "Images and Videos" section in the product edit page.
